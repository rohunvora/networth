# 🚀 Plaid Quick Start - Get Link Opening TODAY

## ✅ What We've Done
1. Added Plaid URL scheme to Info.plist
2. Created minimal PlaidService.swift
3. Added "Connect Bank Account" button to UI

## 🎯 Your Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Add Plaid SDK Package (5 minutes)
In Xcode:
1. **File** → **Add Package Dependencies**
2. Enter URL: `https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios`
3. Version: **Up to Next Major** from `4.1.0`
4. Click **Add Package**
5. Select **LinkKit** → Add to **NetworthTracker** target

### 2. Create Plaid Account (10 minutes)
1. Go to https://dashboard.plaid.com/signup
2. Sign up with your email
3. Company name: "NetWorthTracker" (or your choice)
4. Complete signup

### 3. Get Your API Keys (2 minutes)
1. In Plaid Dashboard → **API Keys**
2. Copy these (keep them safe!):
   - Client ID: `_________________`
   - Sandbox Secret: `_________________`

### 4. Create a Test Link Token (5 minutes)
1. In Plaid Dashboard → **Link**
2. Click **Create Link Token**
3. Use these settings:
   ```
   Products: accounts, balances
   Country: US
   Language: en
   User ID: test_user
   Client Name: NetWorthTracker
   ```
4. Click **Create token**
5. Copy the generated token (starts with `link-sandbox-...`)

### 5. Update Your Code (2 minutes)
In `PlaidService.swift`, replace:
```swift
let linkToken = "link-sandbox-YOUR-TOKEN-HERE"
```
With your actual token from step 4.

### 6. Run and Test! (5 minutes)
1. Build and run the app (Cmd+R)
2. Tap the big blue **"Connect Bank Account"** button
3. Plaid Link should open! 🎉

### 7. Test with Sandbox Credentials
When Plaid Link opens:
1. Search for any bank (e.g., "Chase")
2. Username: `user_good`
3. Password: `pass_good`
4. Select accounts to connect
5. Click Continue

### 8. Check Your Console
You should see:
```
✅ Plaid Link opened!
🎉 SUCCESS! Public token: pk_test_...
🏦 Institution: Chase
📊 Accounts: 3
```

## 🎊 Success = You See Plaid Link Open!

That's it for today! If you see the Plaid Link interface open in your app, you've proven the integration works. 

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Invalid link token"
- Token expired (they last 4 hours)
- Generate a new one from dashboard

### Import errors
- Make sure you added the Plaid SDK package
- Try: Product → Clean Build Folder

### Link won't open
- Check console for error messages
- Ensure you're running on iOS 14.0+

### Crash when opening
- We handle the view controller properly, but check console

## 📝 Tomorrow's Plan
Once Link opens successfully:
1. Set up Firebase backend
2. Exchange public token for access token
3. Fetch real account balances
4. Display in your app

**Remember**: Today's only goal is to see Plaid Link open. Everything else comes later!
