# Net Worth Tracker - Development Scratchpad

## üéØ Project Mission
**One number that's always right.** Give users their exact net worth in 5 seconds, updated automatically.

## ‚ö° CRITICAL INSIGHT (Updated)
**Current State**: Beautiful manual net worth tracker
**Core Problem**: Fragmented assets that are painful to aggregate  
**Gap**: Users still have to manually enter and update everything

**We haven't actually solved the problem yet!**

## üî• TODAY'S MISSION: Get Plaid Link Opening

### Current Status
- [x] Added Plaid URL scheme to Info.plist
- [x] Created minimal PlaidService.swift
- [x] Added Connect Bank Account button
- [ ] Add Plaid SDK to project
- [ ] Get link token from dashboard
- [ ] See Plaid Link open in app

### Success = When you see:
```
‚úÖ Plaid Link opened!
üéâ SUCCESS! Public token: pk_test_...
```

**Nothing else matters today!** Just get Link opening.

## üìä Current State (v1.0)

### ‚úÖ Completed Features
- [x] Core iOS app structure (SwiftUI, iOS 17+)
- [x] Net worth display with prominent number
- [x] Daily change tracking with color coding
- [x] Asset categorization by type
- [x] Manual asset entry form
- [x] Local persistence (UserDefaults)
- [x] Sample data for demo
- [x] Clean, modern UI
- [x] Basic Plaid integration structure

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions
- **UI Framework**: SwiftUI (modern, declarative)
- **State Management**: ObservableObject + @Published
- **Data Storage**: UserDefaults (simple for v1)
- **Minimum iOS**: 17.0 (latest features)
- **External SDKs**: Plaid Link iOS (v4.1.0+)

## üö® REVISED PRIORITIES - What Actually Solves The Problem

### Priority 1: Plaid Integration (Solves 60% of problem)
**This is THE killer feature** - Without this, users still manually enter bank balances

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Basic UI for connecting accounts
- [ ] User can tap "Connect Account" ‚Üê TODAY'S GOAL
- [ ] Plaid Link opens with bank list ‚Üê TODAY'S GOAL
- [ ] User authenticates with their bank
- [ ] Accounts appear automatically
- [ ] Balances update on app launch
- [ ] Access tokens stored securely

**Implementation Plan**: See detailed Plaid section below

### Priority 2: Crypto Wallet Integration (Solves 30% of problem)
**Goal**: Wallet address ‚Üí automatic balance

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Add wallet by address
- [ ] Auto-fetch ETH balance
- [ ] Support top 5 tokens (USDT, USDC, etc)
- [ ] Update on app launch

**Implementation**:
1. Create EtherscanService.swift
2. Add wallet address input
3. Fetch balances via Etherscan API
4. Store addresses securely

### Priority 3: Real-Time Price Updates
**Goal**: Make it "always right"

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Auto-update stock prices
- [ ] Auto-update crypto prices
- [ ] Show last update time
- [ ] Handle errors gracefully

### ‚ùå DEPRIORITIZED (Move to v2)
- Asset Detail View (nice to have)
- Data Export (nice to have)  
- Charts (nice to have)
- Search (premature optimization)

## üìã Plaid Integration - Detailed Implementation

### Pre-Setup
1. **Create Plaid Account**
   - Sign up at plaid.com
   - Get Development credentials
   - Note: client_id, secret, public_key

2. **Choose Products**
   - ‚úÖ Accounts - See all user accounts
   - ‚úÖ Balances - Get current balances
   - ‚úÖ Investments - Brokerage holdings
   - ‚ùå Transactions (not needed for v1)

### Implementation Tasks

#### Task 1: Install Plaid SDK (0.5 hours)
- [x] Add SPM dependency: `https://github.com/plaid/plaid-link-ios`
- [ ] Import LinkKit in project
- [ ] Verify build succeeds

#### Task 2: Create PlaidService.swift (2 hours)
- [x] Link token creation method
- [x] Link handler setup
- [x] Success callback handling
- [x] Error handling

```swift
// Core structure
class PlaidService: ObservableObject {
    @Published var isLinkActive = false
    @Published var linkedAccounts: [PlaidAccount] = []
    
    func openLink() { }
    func exchangePublicToken(_ publicToken: String) { }
    func fetchAccounts(accessToken: String) { }
}
```

#### Task 3: Setup Backend for Token Exchange (3 hours)
**Critical**: Cannot call Plaid APIs directly from app

Options:
1. **Firebase Functions** (Recommended for speed)
2. **AWS Lambda**
3. **Simple Node.js server**

Required endpoints:
- `/exchange_token` - Public ‚Üí Access token
- `/get_balances` - Fetch account balances

#### Task 4: Integrate with PortfolioManager (1 hour)
- [ ] Add `isPlaidLinked` flag to Asset model
- [ ] Create `addPlaidAccount()` method
- [ ] Implement `refreshPlaidAccounts()`
- [ ] Update persistence to handle tokens

#### Task 5: UI Integration (1 hour)
- [x] Add "Connect Account" button
- [x] Handle Plaid Link flow
- [x] Show loading states
- [ ] Display connected accounts

#### Task 6: Testing with Sandbox (1 hour)
- [ ] Use sandbox credentials
- [ ] Test with username: `user_good`, password: `pass_good`
- [ ] Verify balances appear
- [ ] Test refresh functionality

### Security Considerations
- **NEVER** store access tokens in UserDefaults
- Use Keychain or backend storage only
- Encrypt tokens at rest
- Implement token refresh logic

### Error Handling
- [ ] Bank connection failures
- [ ] Token expiration
- [ ] Rate limiting
- [ ] Network errors

## üéØ Success Metrics for Real v1

**Ship when a user can:**
1. Connect 1 bank account (Plaid) ‚úÖ
2. Add 1 crypto wallet (address ‚Üí balance) ‚úÖ
3. Add 1 manual investment ‚úÖ
4. See accurate, auto-updating total ‚úÖ

**That's it. Everything else is v2.**

## üìù The "Magic Moment" Test

‚ùå **Current app**: User manually enters Schwab balance of $374,350
‚úÖ **Real v1**: User connects Schwab ‚Üí sees $374,982.47 (exact, real-time)

This difference - manual vs automatic - is EVERYTHING.

## üêõ Known Issues

### Bug Tracker
1. **Decimal Input** - Currency fields don't handle decimals well on some locales
2. **Refresh Animation** - Loading state doesn't show during refresh
3. **Large Numbers** - Formatting breaks above $100M
4. **PlaidService** - Need to add actual link token (temporary hardcoded)

### Technical Debt
1. **UserDefaults Limits** - Need Core Data for larger portfolios
2. **No Error Handling** - API calls need proper error states
3. **No Tests** - Add unit tests for PortfolioManager
4. **Hardcoded Token** - Need proper token generation flow

## üí° Design Principles

1. **Speed First** - Every interaction should be instant
2. **One Tap Away** - Key info accessible in one tap
3. **No Cognitive Load** - Interface should be self-explanatory
4. **Trust Through Accuracy** - Always show data freshness
5. **Progressive Disclosure** - Simple by default, powerful when needed

## üìù Quick Decision Framework

For any feature request, ask:
1. **Does it automate data collection?** If no, it's v2.
2. **Does it help users trust the number?** If no, defer.
3. **Can it work without manual updates?** If no, rethink.
4. **Is it simpler than the alternative?** Always choose simple.

Remember: We're not building a portfolio tracker. We're building an automatic net worth aggregator. Manual entry is a fallback, not the feature.
