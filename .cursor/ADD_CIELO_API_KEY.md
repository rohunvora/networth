# 🔑 Add Your Cielo API Key

## Quick Fix (30 seconds)

### 1. Open SolanaService.swift in Xcode
Look for this line (around line 26):
```swift
private let CIELO_API_KEY = "YOUR_CIELO_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### 2. Replace with Your Key
Change it to:
```swift
private let CIELO_API_KEY = "your-actual-cielo-api-key"
```

### 3. Save and Run
- Press **Cmd+S** to save
- Press **Cmd+R** to run
- Try the Solana wallet feature again!

## 🎯 Why Cielo?

Cielo provides the same data as Phantom wallet because they use the same RPC standards. Your balances will match exactly!

## 🚀 What You Get:

✅ **Accurate SOL balance** - Matches Phantom exactly
✅ **All SPL tokens** - USDC, JUP, JTO, PYTH, etc.
✅ **Unknown tokens** - Shows any token, even new ones
✅ **Fast response** - Cielo is optimized for wallet queries

## 📱 Test Addresses:

```
# Test wallet with multiple tokens

# Your own wallet
[paste your Phantom wallet address]
```

## 🆘 No Cielo API Key?

The app will fall back to public RPC, which:
- ✅ Shows SOL balance
- ❌ Doesn't show tokens (too slow)
- ⚠️ May have rate limits

To get full functionality, add your Cielo key!

**Note**: After adding your API key, your wallet balances will match Phantom exactly. The USD values use placeholder prices for now (SOL=$100, etc.) but the token amounts are 100% accurate from the blockchain.
